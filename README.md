Calculations for solar irradiation of migratory birds in flight.

The ``SMARTS`` module contains functions for calling SMARTS: Simple Model of the
Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine, from NREL, developed by
Dr. Christian Gueymard.

SMARTS software can be obtained from:
    https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/smarts.html

Users will be responsible to obtain a copy of SMARTS  from NREL,
honor itâ€™s license, and download the SMART files into their PVLib folder.
